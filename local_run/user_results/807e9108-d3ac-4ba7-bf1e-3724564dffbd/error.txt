One (or more) file name(s) contain illegal character such as parenthesis, pipes, or slashes.<br>\nIn order to avoid downstream parsing errors, {flask_interface_consts.WEBSERVER_NAME} automatically replaces these spaces with dashes. For some reason, the replacement for {file_name} failed. Please make sure all your input files names contain only dashes, dots, and alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and re-submit your job.
